## Name
Dorm Review App

## Description
In our app, you can search for dorm rooms on campus based on the house you want the room to be in, the floor of that house,
the type of room, and the availability of the room. After doing the research, you will be able to choose from the results of your search
and enter a room profile for the selected room. In the room profile, you will be able to see images of the room and reviews of the room.
You can also write a review so that it will show up under the Reviews section of the room profile. You can always go back and
select another room, or you can go back and make another search.


## Roadmap
We want to add a feature to save rooms to Your Favorites so you fins the rooms you liked easily. We also want to improve 
Write A Review feature so that users can add photos and a rating to their review.

## Limitations

You can't delete a review after you submit it and the availability can't be updated by the user. The fixes are possible, 
but they required more time than we had.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The authors are Alexandra Guillen and Hamida Rahimi. Shoutout to all the coaches and Rui for helping us make this app!

## Project status
We cut back on some of the nice-to-have functionality like adding favorites and uploading pictures to fix what 
we already had. So this is the final product.
