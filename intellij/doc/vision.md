# Vision

## The student looking for a room
The student will be able to choose what house, what floor, and what type of room they are looking for to help in there
search for a room to choose in the draw.
- choose house and other preferences
- read reviews and look at pictures
- search for specific rooms
- favorite room they like

## Past Resident
It can be a past or current resident but basically it is some who has access to the room and is living or has lived
there so that they can give their review or upload picture of the room to better "inform" future/possible residents.
- enter room info
- write room review
- leave a rating 
- upload pictures

## Housing/ROC/ResLife
Since it is most likely that not everyone on campus puts information into the app,
then we can get basic information from Housing to give students some idea/info of the room.
Also, the student can know if the room is even available for them to choose from.
- enter room info
- enter availability
