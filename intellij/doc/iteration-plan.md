# Iteration Plan

The most important use case would be the search for room because this is the first step that the students will do.
The risk of this case would be the information that the students are looking for. For instance if a student is searching for a single
and the search for room is not showing the singles, or it shows the wrong information. About the coverage search for room is covering the most information 
in the use cases. Since search for room is the first and important step that students will go for it, so it is very crucial and plays a big role in the app. 

The second important use case that we are working on it is View room. Students are viewing the rooms and will be able to leave a review note.
Students can favourite and save the rooms too. The risky part in this use case would be the students can't view the rooms or they are not able to leave a review.
This can also apply for the students are looking for the review, and they can't see the review. Either the information are not saved or not accurate. 
Since this use case also uses much information it also helps a lot of the jobs get done. The critical parts would be displaying the rooms 
and updating the favorites and saved information.
