# Iteration Plan

The most important use case would be the Write Review use case because this is the information that 
the students are looking for. The risks would be for the information uploaded not being saved or seen
by the users, but also the possibility that information students upload not being accurate or appropriate.
So things to consider would what kind of level, if any, of restriction for students leaving reviews. Also, thinking of 
reasons why reviews wouldn't be saved or seen and preventing those.
